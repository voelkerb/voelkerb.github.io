## About me

I am a research associate of the Chair of Computer Architecture at the University of Freiburg, Germany, where I am working since 2016. I previously studied in Freiburg and received the M.Sc. in Embbed Systems Engineering in 2016. 

My current research focuses on wirelessly connected embedded systems, particular in the field of electricity data generation and distribution. 

I am teaching several lab courses at the university including _Microcontroller and FPGA Systems_ and _Wearable Computing Systems_.
